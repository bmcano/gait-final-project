## Features

- **Personalized Itineraries**: Tailored trip plans based on user preferences like destination, dates, and interests.
- **Visual Previews**: AI-generated images and videos of attractions for better decision-making.

- **Intuitive UI**: A clean, Material Design-inspired interface for easy navigation.
